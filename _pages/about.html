<p>In a digitising society that is constantly evolving, the influence of web technologies on government organisations is growing rapidly. 
As researchers in the research group for media, innovation and communication technologies (imec-mict-ugent), we express our ideas, comments and reflections/visions from our research projects on this blog.</p></p>
<br>
Short intro on our research projects:

<p><h5>- Smart Flanders:</h5>
A support programme of the Flemish Government for the 13 central cities.
Smart Flanders does this by focusing on real-time open data and shared reference models, and aims to stimulate cooperation between cities and actors from the quadruple helix. 
The common basic principles are set out in an urban Open Data Charter adopted by the 13 central cities in 2018. 
The Flemish Government also recognised the importance of these shared agreements and adopted the Open Data Charter.
Smart Flanders is implementation-driven and supports cities not only to draw up and disseminate a supported vision on open data, but also to put it into practice and to make interesting city data accessible. 
Within the programme, a number of pilot projects are planned that start from a social challenge that lives within the cities. 
By using this approach and "learning by doing", Smart Flanders aims to make data as accessible as possible, with a view to maximum reuse as a basis for smarter services and applications. 
The data pilots that are carried out within the scope of this project can be found on this <a href="https://smart.flanders.be/piloten/">website</a>.</p>  <br>

<p><h5>- Local Decisions as Linked Open Data (LBLOD)</h5>
The LBLOD project was launched in 2015 and aims to publish local decisions as linked open data so that this information can be exchanged automatically between local and higher authorities. 
This makes it easy to re-use information, which reduces the administrative burden, simplifies decision-making processes and policy planning and, in addition, provides better and more efficient services to citizens. 
Because these data are published on the Web, the project ensures that data from local decisions can also be re-used by non-state actors, such as citizens, civil society organisations and businesses. 
In this way, an open government is created that transparently opens up its data to the outside world. </p> <br>

<p><h5>- Open Standaarden voor Linkende organisaties (OSLO)</h5>
The Flemish government is committed to an unambiguous standard for the exchange of information. 
The aim is to ensure more coherence and better findability of data. 
In this way, everyone can use the data more easily.
With OSLO, efforts are being made to achieve semantic and technical interoperability. Standardising the meaning of information is essential to realise the Flanders Radical Digital principle 'don't ask what you already know'. 
The vocabularies and application profiles are developed in co-creation with Flemish administrations, local authorities, federal partners, the European Commission and private partners (meanwhile more than 88 authors). 
Finally, a scalable process and the method for developing, modifying data standards, and managing the life cycle of these standards were also elaborated.<br>

<p><h5>- EBSI</h5> 
The European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) aims to become a "standard" digital infrastructure to support the launch and operation of cross-border public services across the EU using blockchain technology, 
with the aim of establishing themselves in virtually every public domain that can benefit from this technology. 
EBSI focuses on specific use cases in which blockchain technology can improve cross-border digital public services.
These use cases are identified and selected each year by the member states (European Blockchain Partnership) and the European Commission.
The use cases for 2019 are: European Self-Sovereign Identity, Diplomas, Notarisation and Trusted Data Sharing.</p> <br>
