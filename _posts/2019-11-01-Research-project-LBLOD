The LBLOD project was launched in 2015 and aims to publish local decisions as linked open data so that this information can be exchanged automatically between local and higher authorities. This makes it easy to re-use information, which reduces the administrative burden, simplifies decision-making processes and policy planning and, in addition, provides better and more efficient services to citizens. Because these data are published on the Web, the project ensures that data from local decisions can also be re-used by non-state actors, such as citizens, civil society organisations and businesses. In this way, an open government is created that transparently opens up its data to the outside world.
