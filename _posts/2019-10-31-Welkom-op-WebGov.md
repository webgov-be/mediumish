Welcome to our blog WebGov. 
We are two researchers of imec-mict-UGent. This interdisciplinary research group is part of Communication Sciences and Industrial Systems Engineering and Product Design at Ghent University. 
The research group is also part of the Flemish strategic research centre Imec.

From our work in various research projects, we come into contact with different challenges at the crossroads of the web and the government.
In this blog, we want to mention a number of ideas, comments and open issues on this theme.
