The European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) aims to become a "standard" digital infrastructure to support the launch and operation of cross-border public services across the EU using blockchain technology, 
with the aim of establishing themselves in virtually every public domain that can benefit from this technology. 
EBSI focuses on specific use cases in which blockchain technology can improve cross-border digital public services.
These use cases are identified and selected each year by the member states (European Blockchain Partnership) and the European Commission.
The use cases for 2019 are: European Self-Sovereign Identity, Diplomas, Notarisation and Trusted Data Sharing.
