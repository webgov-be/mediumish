#### Context
Last week I attended Convergence 2019, the first global blockchain conference. This conference brought together the worldwide blockchain community for an intense dialog with regulators, policy makers, industry influencers and members of the social impact community.

As our task within the EBSI project is to work on a social assessment, we proposed to conduct a workshop with the member states during the Use Case working group (part of a closed meeting during the conference).

#### Goal
The aim of this workshop was to get a better insight on the social and economic impact of the different use cases of EBSI.

#### Setup
The workshop existed of four exercises that were completed by the participants within each use case group:
1. Listing all the different stakeholders and adopting a stakeholder per participant
2. Defining positive and negative aspects or drivers or barriers for the stakeholder you adopted
3. Further specification of these stakeholders in terms of value and incentives
for the drivers/benefits
e.g. Savings (Which benefits are savings?), Efficiency (Which benefits are efficiency?) or New possibilities (Which valuable possibilities does the new solution bring?). 
for the barriers/disadvantages e.g. Expenses (Does the new situation lead to any extra expenses?)
4. Deciding which aspects are in and out control of your stakeholder by doing a SWOT-analysis.
